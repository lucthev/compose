 * of Choice.Selection, is passed to listeners as a first parameter;
 * the old selection is passed as a second parameter. Note that the
 * second parameter is not guaranteed to be an instance of Choice.Selection;
 * in the case the editor was previously blurred, it will be false.
 *
 * NOTE: although this module is not specific to any mode, is does
 * require the 'getChildren' function of those modes. It should not
 * be 'used' by Compose itself but by the modes.
 *
 * Module overview:
 * @require {setImmediate, getChildren}
 * @listen {mouseup, focus, blur, keydown}
 * @emit {selectionchange}
