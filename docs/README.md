# Documentation

These files aim to provide API documentation for Compose. They should provide a high-level overview of the usage and purpose of each module; if you're interested in the details of how things work, the code is fairly well documented.

## Structure

The layout of these files matches that of the [src/](https://github.com/lucthev/compose/tree/master/src/) directory. If you'd like to see the API for [src/selection.js](https://github.com/lucthev/compose/tree/master/src/selection.js), for example, have a look at [docs/selection.md](https://github.com/lucthev/compose/tree/master/docs/selection.md).

## Getting started

To get started, check out the documentation [for compose.js](https://github.com/lucthev/compose/tree/master/docs/compose.md)
